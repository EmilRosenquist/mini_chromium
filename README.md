`mini_chromium` library - Build2 package
================================

 - mini_chromium : https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/mini_chromium/
 - Build2 : https://build2.org

Note: This is the source code for the build2 package of the `mini_chromium` C++ library,
the actual library sources snapshot can be found in the `./upstream/` submodule.

Upstream doesn't seem to bother with versioning. As a result, we stick to
`0.X.Y`, that is, keeping it alpha (the first component is `0`) implying that
there are no stability guarantees.
